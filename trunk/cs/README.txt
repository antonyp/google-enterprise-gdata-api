Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Administrative and Policy ACL APIs

The Google Search Appliance Administrative API enables you to programmatically
access the Admin Console. The API provides functions for creating, retrieving,
updating, and deleting search appliance configurations.

The Google Search Appliance Policy ACL API enables you to programmatically
configure policy access control lists on a search appliance. You can use this
API to add users or groups to a URL pattern to which you restrict access. The
policy ACL software improves search appliance performance by substantially
reducing HEAD requests for user authorization information from remote servers.

The Google Search Appliance Administrative and Policy ACL APIs follow the
principles of Google Data APIs. Google Data APIs are based on both the Atom 1.0
and RSS 2.0 syndication formats in addition to the Atom Publishing Protocol.
